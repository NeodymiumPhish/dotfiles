# dotfiles
## This is a store of my personal dotfiles
They need some work, I know, but the primary purpose for this repo is for storing them so they're easy to pull for later use. 

install.sh creates symlinks to the git cloned directory.  

# Future plans:
- Develop a way of contextually determining the files and their symlinks' expected location/filename.
- Clear out existing files before generating symlinks.
